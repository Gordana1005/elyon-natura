-- INSIGHTS → PURE PROFIT + MARGINS (Чиста добивка · Маржи) — 2026-09-28
--
-- ONE read-only RPC, public.insights_profit(p_from, p_to_end, p_clock,
-- p_granularity, p_detail) → jsonb, feeding GET /api/insights/profit (api
-- module supabase/functions/api/insightsProfit.ts, which applies the rate
-- card, VAT, the commission gate and does the P&L arithmetic). It REPLACES
-- NOTHING: insights_orders_rollup / insights_paid_basis / insights_products /
-- insights_channel_pl stay exactly as they are (Payout + the parity harness).
--
-- WHY (audit 2026-09-28): the old tab counted "cash" as the order price of
-- rows the CRM calls paid, created in the window (10.176.707 ден in
-- September against 15.439.008 ден MEX actually delivered); it read orders
-- only (no web shop, no MEX-only parcels); it charged the BG courier blend
-- (440.902 ден of phantom cost in September); product cost covered ~32 % of
-- packages with no badge; and its channel P&L sat on the prediction-first
-- order_channel() instead of the four sale sources.
--
-- TWO CLOCKS, never mixed (every sale / parcel read from the foundation,
-- 20260940000000 — nothing here re-derives what a sale is):
--   p_clock 'cohort'  the sales MADE in the window (insights_sale_rows: sale
--                     day, Skopje; four sources; MEX-first buckets). Each sale's
--                     group: collected = paid (MEX Delivered) + paid_legacy
--                     (operator ruling / legacy import) · returned · open
--                     (at the courier, problem, label, to pack) · unproven
--                     (CRM paid, no parcel — never profit). Value = the
--                     foundation's value_mkd (parcel COD | price × 61,5 | shop
--                     total). The strip (source × bucket) ties to
--                     insights_cohort, bucket by bucket.
--   p_clock 'cash'    the money that LANDED in the window (insights_cash_rows:
--                     every MEX parcel delivered, any sale day, once, with its
--                     owner) — revenue = COD + the card money of a card-paid
--                     web order; ties to insights_cohort().cash_flow. Parcels
--                     MEX returned in the window (returned_at) are counted by
--                     source for the return-fee line.
--
-- LINES (collected + returned sales only). Every sale is split into its lines
-- so product cost can be charged:
--   orders      order_items (a row with no lines prices its own product_name /
--               quantity); web: web_order_items (SALE by price × qty −
--               discount, GIFT at 0); MEX-only parcels: ONE pseudo line
--               '__mex_only__' (contents unknown → uncosted revenue).
--   value split the sale's value by price weight (ppu × qty, else total_price;
--               all zero → by packages), so Σ lines = the sale's value.
--   key         product_key() (product_id / a reviewed alias), else the
--               catalogue product whose product_alias_norm(name) is EXACTLY
--               the line's (case / spaces ignored), else 'n:<name>'. Spelling
--               variants still wait for reviewed product_aliases rows.
--   kind        a reviewed alias decides; until then the obvious non-product
--               lines of the collabBox / CRM imports are recognised by name
--               (поен-… loyalty_point · достав… delivery · забелешк… note ·
--               флаер… flyer) and are NOT packages; web GIFT = gift.
--               product | gift lines are packages; a package with no price
--               weight in a priced sale is a FREE package.
--   cost        products.cost_price > 0 (EUR, × 61,5) — never invented. A
--               package without one is UNCOSTED; its revenue is reported
--               apart (the api estimates it only on request and labels it).
--   courier     each sale's parcel split over its packages (a parcel two
--               orders share counts once).
--   commission  index.ts orderPackageBonus(), UNCHANGED: per package by the
--               line's unit price (<25 € → 1 · 25–35 → 2 · ≥35 → 3), only when
--               the order's status is 'paid'; returned RAW per owner
--               (ownerOf() before normAgent) so the api applies today's
--               agents-only gate. Payout / bonus math is not touched.

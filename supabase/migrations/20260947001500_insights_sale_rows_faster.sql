-- Insights speed (owner 02.10.2026, "Insights faster when we log in"; the floor closed, production
-- changes allowed that night). insights_sale_rows runs 3x per Overview load (cohort, people, sales)
-- and inside every Insights tab. Same rows, cheaper plan — four CTEs, nothing else:
--   sh0   only the tracking ids an order of THIS window can hold (the index superset ob already
--         uses), each gated by an index-only "held twice at all?" count before the exact count;
--         was: every tracking id of all history (~56k) grouped on every call (~200 ms).
--         shr still sees every holder of a kept id, so each share is the whole-history one.
--   bk0   collabbox_name_key (~0,2 ms a call) only for a booking with no phone — the one rule
--         that reads it; was: for every booking (~80 ms).
--   bk    the author's-own-sale probe is gated on k.p8 IS NULL (an OR gate, not a join filter):
--         65 probes instead of ~390 (~100 ms → ~10 ms).
--   cs/dbl  one probe of idx_orders_phone_last8 per MEX-only parcel with a COD (a scalar
--         sub-select, so it stays a probe); was a sequential scan of all orders (~300 ms).
-- Untouched: led (~47 ms), mo, the order branch's per-row cohort_order_source (its SET search_path
-- keeps it from inlining — the one definition of the department stays where it is).
-- Measured before the switch (EXPLAIN ANALYZE, the new body as a session-only function):
-- today 854 → ~265 ms, September 1.191 → ~640 ms; planning 110 → 62 ms.
-- Proof (same snapshot, old vs new, 20260947001500 session tests): the rows (sorted, md5) of
-- today / yesterday / last 7 days / September / 2026 with and without keys are identical; the shared-
-- parcel shares joined to a window's orders are identical for windows holding one, both or none
-- of a shared parcel's holders; every caller (cohort, people, sales, lists, returns, stock, work_credited,
-- leaderboard_day_v2, bonus_month, bonus_prediction_day, orders_bookings_rows, profit) returns the
-- same bytes — except insights_profit's float8 histogram for September in its 9th decimal
-- (10846.888854798 → …799 ден): it sums float8 in arrival order, and the OLD function gives the
-- same …799 under its own different plan (enable_bitmapscan = off), so that digit already follows
-- the plan, not the logic.
